This topic describes how to set up DNS for your Cloud Foundry environment. 

##<a id='domains'></a> Domains

Your must create several wildcard DNS records to point to your load balancer(s) or router(s). Consult the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Domain</th>
<th>Example</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TCP</td>
<td>*.tcp.example.com</td>
<td>This handles TCP traffic destined for the TCP Router.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HTTP</td>
<td>*.sys.example.com</td>
<td>This is the system domain that handles HTTP traffic for system components destined for the Gorouter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HTTP</td>
<td>*.example.com</td>
<td>This is the app domain that handles HTTP traffic for applications destined for the Gorouter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WebSockets</td>
<td>*.ws.example.com</td>
<td>This is an optional domain that handles WebSocket traffic destined for the Gorouter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SSH</td>
<td>*.ssh.example.com</td>
<td>This is an optional domain that provides SSH access to application containers.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Cloud Foundry gives each application its own hostname in your app domain. With a wildcard DNS record, every hostname in your domain resolves to the IP address of your router or load balancer, and you do not need to configure an A record for each app hostname. For example, if you create a DNS record for a system domain <code>*.example.com</code> pointing to your router, every application deployed to the <code>example.com</code> domain resolves to the IP address of your router.</p>

##<a id='examples'></a> Example Topologies

Your exact configuration will vary significantly depending on your IaaS and your load balancing configuration. Below are two example topologies: the [first](#aws) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployment using Elastic Load Balancer (ELBs), and the [second](#haproxy) uses HAProxy for load balancing.

###<a id='aws'></a> AWS

This topology has DNS configured to point five domains to four ELBs:

###<a id='haproxy'></a> HAProxy

This topology has DNS configured to point five domains to one HAProxy:
