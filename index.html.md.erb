title: Overview of Deploying Cloud Foundry
owner: Release Integration
---

Cloud Foundry is designed to be configured, deployed, managed, scaled, and
upgraded on any cloud IaaS provider. Cloud Foundry achieves this by leveraging
[BOSH](https://bosh.io/), an open source tool for release engineering,
deployment, lifecycle management, and distributed systems monitoring.

`cf-deployment` is the recommended way to deploy Cloud Foundry. `cf-release` is the older way to deploy Cloud Foundry, and will soon be deprecated.

If installing Cloud Foundry for the first time, [deploy](./cf-deployment/index.html) with `cf-deployment`.

If you have an existing Cloud Foundry deployment that uses `cf-release`, [migrate](./migrating.html) your deployment to `cf-deployment`.
