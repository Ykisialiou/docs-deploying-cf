Cloud Foundry is designed to be configured, deployed, managed, scaled, and
upgraded on any cloud IaaS provider. Cloud Foundry achieves this by leveraging
[BOSH](https://bosh.io/), an open source tool for release engineering,
deployment, lifecycle management, and distributed systems monitoring.

`cf-deployment` is the recommended way to deploy Cloud Foundry. 
You can also deploy Cloud Foundry using the older `cf-release` method. If you deployed Cloud Foundry with `cf-release`, you can migrate your deployment to `cf-deployment`.

Refer to the following topics for more information about how to deploy and migrate Cloud Foundry:
