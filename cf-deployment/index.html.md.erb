This topic describes how to deploy Cloud Foundry using `cf-deployment`. 

`cf-deployment` offers a new way to deploy Cloud Foundry that relies on individual component releases. To deploy Cloud Foundry with the older `cf-release` method, see [Deploying Cloud Foundry with cf-release](../cf-release/index.html).

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

In contrast to `cf-release`, `cf-deployment` prioritizes the following:

* Readability for a human operator by including only the necessary configuration
* Security and production-readiness by default
* High availability 
* Native use of [Diego](../concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html) and lack of support for [Droplet Execution Agents](../concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html)
* Platform data persistence 
* Load balancing handled by the IaaS or an external deployment

###<a id='prepare'></a> Prepare Your Environment

Before deploying Cloud Foundry with `cf-deployment`, you must prepare your environment and deploy a BOSH Director.

The procedures vary depending on your IaaS. Select the topic specific to your IaaS:

* [Deploying BOSH on AWS](../common/aws.html)
* [Deploying BOSH on GCP](gcp.html)

After preparing your environment and deploying a BOSH Director, continue to the [Deploying Cloud Foundry](deploy-cf.html) topic.
