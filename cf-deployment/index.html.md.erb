This topic describes how to deploy Cloud Foundry
using `cf-deployment`.

`cf-deployment` offers a new way to deploy Cloud Foundry
that relies on individual component releases.
To deploy Cloud Foundry with the older `cf-release` method,
see [Deploying Cloud Foundry with cf-release](../cf-release/index.html).

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

In contrast to `cf-release`, `cf-deployment` prioritizes:

* Readability for a human operator -
  `cf-deployment` includes only necessary configuration
* Security and production-readiness by default
* Native use of [Diego](../concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html)
  and lack of support for [Droplet Execution Agents](../concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html)

###<a id='prepare'></a> Prepare Your Environment

Before deploying Cloud Foundry with `cf-deployment`,
you must prepare your environment
and deploy a BOSH Director.

The procedures vary depending on your IaaS.
Select the topic specific to your IaaS:

* [Deploying BOSH on AWS](../common/aws.html)
* [Deploying BOSH on GCP](gcp.html)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
The topics for preparing your environment
use the bosh-bootloader tool.
bosh-bootloader is currently only compatible
with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

###<a id='deploy'></a> Deploy Cloud Foundry

After preparing your environment
and deploying a BOSH Director,
continue to the [Deploying Cloud Foundry](deploy-cf.html) topic.
